Ehsan loves geometry! Especially he likes to rotate points!Given a point in the plane, Ehsan likes to rotate it by k degrees (counter-clockwise), around the origin. What is the result of this rotation?

InputA single integer k (0 ≤ k < 360) is given in the first line. Two integer numbers x and y are given in the second line ( - 1390 ≤ x, y ≤ 1390).

OutputWrite two numbers. The result of the rotation. Your answer must have a relative error less than 10 - 1.
