Permutation p is an ordered set of integers p1,  p2,  ...,  pn, consisting of n distinct positive integers, each of them doesn't exceed n. We'll denote the i-th element of permutation p as pi. We'll call number n the size or the length of permutation p1,  p2,  ...,  pn.You have a sequence of integers a1, a2, ..., an. In one move, you are allowed to decrease or increase any number by one. Count the minimum number of moves, needed to build a permutation from this sequence.

InputThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 3·105) — the size of the sought permutation. The second line contains n integers a1, a2, ..., an ( - 109 ≤ ai ≤ 109).

OutputPrint a single number — the minimum number of moves.Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.
