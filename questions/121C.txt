Petya loves lucky numbers. Everybody knows that lucky numbers are positive integers whose decimal representation contains only the lucky digits 4 and 7. For example, numbers 47, 744, 4 are lucky and 5, 17, 467 are not.One day Petya dreamt of a lexicographically k-th permutation of integers from 1 to n. Determine how many lucky numbers in the permutation are located on the positions whose indexes are also lucky numbers.

InputThe first line contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 109) — the number of elements in the permutation and the lexicographical number of the permutation.

OutputIf the k-th permutation of numbers from 1 to n does not exist, print the single number "-1" (without the quotes). Otherwise, print the answer to the problem: the number of such indexes i, that i and ai are both lucky numbers.
