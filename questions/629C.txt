As Famil Door’s birthday is coming, some of his friends (like Gabi) decided to buy a present for him. His friends are going to buy a string consisted of round brackets since Famil Door loves string of brackets of length n more than any other strings!The sequence of round brackets is called valid if and only if:   the total number of opening brackets is equal to the total number of closing brackets;  for any prefix of the sequence, the number of opening brackets is greater or equal than the number of closing brackets. Gabi bought a string s of length m (m ≤ n) and want to complete it to obtain a valid sequence of brackets of length n. He is going to pick some strings p and q consisting of round brackets and merge them in a string p + s + q, that is add the string p at the beginning of the string s and string q at the end of the string s.Now he wonders, how many pairs of strings p and q exists, such that the string p + s + q is a valid sequence of round brackets. As this number may be pretty large, he wants to calculate it modulo 109 + 7.

InputFirst line contains n and m (1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 100 000, n - m ≤ 2000) — the desired length of the string and the length of the string bought by Gabi, respectively.The second line contains string s of length m consisting of characters '(' and ')' only.

OutputPrint the number of pairs of string p and q such that p + s + q is a valid sequence of round brackets modulo 109 + 7.
