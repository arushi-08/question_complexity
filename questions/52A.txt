There is a given sequence of integers a1, a2, ..., an, where every number is from 1 to 3 inclusively. You have to replace the minimum number of numbers in it so that all the numbers in the sequence are equal to each other.

InputThe first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 106). The second line contains a sequence of integers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 3).

OutputPrint the minimum number of replacements needed to be performed to make all the numbers in the sequence equal.
