Vanya got bored and he painted n distinct points on the plane. After that he connected all the points pairwise and saw that as a result many triangles were formed with vertices in the painted points. He asks you to count the number of the formed triangles with the non-zero area.

InputThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2000) — the number of the points painted on the plane. Next n lines contain two integers each xi, yi ( - 100 ≤ xi, yi ≤ 100) — the coordinates of the i-th point. It is guaranteed that no two given points coincide.

OutputIn the first line print an integer — the number of triangles with the non-zero area among the painted points.
