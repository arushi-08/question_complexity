Simon has an array a1, a2, ..., an, consisting of n positive integers. Today Simon asked you to find a pair of integers l, r (1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n), such that the following conditions hold:  there is integer j (l ≤ j ≤ r), such that all integers al, al + 1, ..., ar are divisible by aj;  value r - l takes the maximum value among all pairs for which condition 1 is true; Help Simon, find the required pair of numbers (l, r). If there are multiple required pairs find all of them.

InputThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 3·105).The second line contains n space-separated integers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 106).

OutputPrint two integers in the first line — the number of required pairs and the maximum value of r - l. On the following line print all l values from optimal pairs in increasing order.
