Fox Ciel and her friends are in a dancing room. There are n boys and m girls here, and they never danced before. There will be some songs, during each song, there must be exactly one boy and one girl are dancing. Besides, there is a special rule:  either the boy in the dancing pair must dance for the first time (so, he didn't dance with anyone before);  or the girl in the dancing pair must dance for the first time. Help Fox Ciel to make a schedule that they can dance as many songs as possible.

InputThe first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100) — the number of boys and girls in the dancing room.

OutputIn the first line print k — the number of songs during which they can dance. Then in the following k lines, print the indexes of boys and girls dancing during songs chronologically. You can assume that the boys are indexed from 1 to n, and the girls are indexed from 1 to m.
