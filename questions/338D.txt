Consider a table G of size n × m such that G(i, j) = GCD(i, j) for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n, 1 ≤ j ≤ m. GCD(a, b) is the greatest common divisor of numbers a and b.You have a sequence of positive integer numbers a1, a2, ..., ak. We say that this sequence occurs in table G if it coincides with consecutive elements in some row, starting from some position. More formally, such numbers 1 ≤ i ≤ n and 1 ≤ j ≤ m - k + 1 should exist that G(i, j + l - 1) = al for all 1 ≤ l ≤ k.Determine if the sequence a occurs in table G.

InputThe first line contains three space-separated integers n, m and k (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 1012; 1 ≤ k ≤ 10000). The second line contains k space-separated integers a1, a2, ..., ak (1 ≤ ai ≤ 1012).

OutputPrint a single word "YES", if the given sequence occurs in table G, otherwise print "NO".
