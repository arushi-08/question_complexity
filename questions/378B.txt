Two semifinals have just been in the running tournament. Each semifinal had n participants. There are n participants advancing to the finals, they are chosen as follows: from each semifinal, we choose k people (0 ≤ 2k ≤ n) who showed the best result in their semifinals and all other places in the finals go to the people who haven't ranked in the top k in their semifinal but got to the n - 2k of the best among the others.The tournament organizers hasn't yet determined the k value, so the participants want to know who else has any chance to get to the finals and who can go home.

InputThe first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of participants in each semifinal.Each of the next n lines contains two integers ai and bi (1 ≤ ai, bi ≤ 109) — the results of the i-th participant (the number of milliseconds he needs to cover the semifinals distance) of the first and second semifinals, correspondingly. All results are distinct. Sequences a1, a2, ..., an and b1, b2, ..., bn are sorted in ascending order, i.e. in the order the participants finished in the corresponding semifinal.

OutputPrint two strings consisting of n characters, each equals either "0" or "1". The first line should correspond to the participants of the first semifinal, the second line should correspond to the participants of the second semifinal. The i-th character in the j-th line should equal "1" if the i-th participant of the j-th semifinal has any chances to advance to the finals, otherwise it should equal a "0".
