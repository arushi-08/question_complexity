Catherine has a deck of n cards, each of which is either red, green, or blue. As long as there are at least two cards left, she can do one of two actions:   take any two (not necessarily adjacent) cards with different colors and exchange them for a new card of the third color;  take any two (not necessarily adjacent) cards with the same color and exchange them for a new card with that color. She repeats this process until there is only one card left. What are the possible colors for the final card?

InputThe first line of the input contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 200) — the total number of cards.The next line contains a string s of length n — the colors of the cards. s contains only the characters 'B', 'G', and 'R', representing blue, green, and red, respectively.

OutputPrint a single string of up to three characters — the possible colors of the final card (using the same symbols as the input) in alphabetical order.
