A subsequence of length |x| of string s = s1s2... s|s| (where |s| is the length of string s) is a string x = sk1sk2... sk|x| (1 ≤ k1 < k2 < ... < k|x| ≤ |s|).You've got two strings — s and t. Let's consider all subsequences of string s, coinciding with string t. Is it true that each character of string s occurs in at least one of these subsequences? In other words, is it true that for all i (1 ≤ i ≤ |s|), there is such subsequence x = sk1sk2... sk|x| of string s, that x = t and for some j (1 ≤ j ≤ |x|) kj = i.

InputThe first line contains string s, the second line contains string t. Each line consists only of lowercase English letters. The given strings are non-empty, the length of each string does not exceed 2·105.

OutputPrint "Yes" (without the quotes), if each character of the string s occurs in at least one of the described subsequences, or "No" (without the quotes) otherwise.
