You are given a sequence of n integers a1, a2, ..., an. Determine a real number x such that the weakness of the sequence a1 - x, a2 - x, ..., an - x is as small as possible.The weakness of a sequence is defined as the maximum value of the poorness over all segments (contiguous subsequences) of a sequence.The poorness of a segment is defined as the absolute value of sum of the elements of segment.

InputThe first line contains one integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 200 000), the length of a sequence.The second line contains n integers a1, a2, ..., an (|ai| ≤ 10 000).

OutputOutput a real number denoting the minimum possible weakness of a1 - x, a2 - x, ..., an - x. Your answer will be considered correct if its relative or absolute error doesn't exceed 10 - 6.
