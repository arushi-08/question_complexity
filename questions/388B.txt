Fox Ciel wants to write a task for a programming contest. The task is: "You are given a simple undirected graph with n vertexes. Each its edge has unit length. You should calculate the number of shortest paths between vertex 1 and vertex 2."Same with some writers, she wants to make an example with some certain output: for example, her birthday or the number of her boyfriend. Can you help her to make a test case with answer equal exactly to k?

InputThe first line contains a single integer k (1 ≤ k ≤ 109).

OutputYou should output a graph G with n vertexes (2 ≤ n ≤ 1000). There must be exactly k shortest paths between vertex 1 and vertex 2 of the graph.The first line must contain an integer n. Then adjacency matrix G with n rows and n columns must follow. Each element of the matrix must be 'N' or 'Y'. If Gij is 'Y', then graph G has a edge connecting vertex i and vertex j. Consider the graph vertexes are numbered from 1 to n.The graph must be undirected and simple: Gii = 'N' and Gij = Gji must hold. And there must be at least one path between vertex 1 and vertex 2. It's guaranteed that the answer exists. If there multiple correct answers, you can output any of them.
