Yaroslav has an array, consisting of (2·n - 1) integers. In a single operation Yaroslav can change the sign of exactly n elements in the array. In other words, in one operation Yaroslav can select exactly n array elements, and multiply each of them by -1.Yaroslav is now wondering: what maximum sum of array elements can be obtained if it is allowed to perform any number of described operations?Help Yaroslav.

InputThe first line contains an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 100). The second line contains (2·n - 1) integers — the array elements. The array elements do not exceed 1000 in their absolute value.

OutputIn a single line print the answer to the problem — the maximum sum that Yaroslav can get.
