There is a given string S consisting of N symbols. Your task is to find the number of ordered pairs of integers i and j such that1. 1 ≤ i, j ≤ N2. S[i] = S[j], that is the i-th symbol of string S is equal to the j-th.

InputThe single input line contains S, consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits. It is guaranteed that string S in not empty and its length does not exceed 105.

OutputPrint a single number which represents the number of pairs i and j with the needed property. Pairs (x, y) and (y, x) should be considered different, i.e. the ordered pairs count.
