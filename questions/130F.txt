You are given an integer n. Output its prime factorization.If n = a1b1a2b2 ... akbk, where ak are prime numbers, the output of your program should look as follows: a1 a1 ... a1 a2 a2 ... a2 ... ak ak ... ak, where factors are ordered in non-decreasing order, and each factor ai is printed bi times.

InputThe only line of input contains an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 250).

OutputOutput the prime factorization of n, as described above.
