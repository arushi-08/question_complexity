Little walrus Fangy loves math very much. That's why when he is bored he plays with a number performing some operations.Fangy takes some positive integer x and wants to get a number one from it. While x is not equal to 1, Fangy repeats the following action: if x is odd, then he adds 1 to it, otherwise he divides x by 2. Fangy knows that for any positive integer number the process ends in finite time.How many actions should Fangy perform to get a number one from number x?

InputThe first line contains a positive integer x in a binary system. It is guaranteed that the first digit of x is different from a zero and the number of its digits does not exceed 106.

OutputPrint the required number of actions.
