A tree is a connected graph that doesn't contain any cycles.The distance between two vertices of a tree is the length (in edges) of the shortest path between these vertices.You are given a tree with n vertices and a positive number k. Find the number of distinct pairs of the vertices which have a distance of exactly k between them. Note that pairs (v, u) and (u, v) are considered to be the same pair.

InputThe first line contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 50000, 1 ≤ k ≤ 500) — the number of vertices and the required distance between the vertices.Next n - 1 lines describe the edges as "ai bi" (without the quotes) (1 ≤ ai, bi ≤ n, ai ≠ bi), where ai and bi are the vertices connected by the i-th edge. All given edges are different.

OutputPrint a single integer — the number of distinct pairs of the tree's vertices which have a distance of exactly k between them.Please do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.
