Iahub and his friend Floyd have started painting a wall. Iahub is painting the wall red and Floyd is painting it pink. You can consider the wall being made of a very large number of bricks, numbered 1, 2, 3 and so on. Iahub has the following scheme of painting: he skips x - 1 consecutive bricks, then he paints the x-th one. That is, he'll paint bricks x, 2·x, 3·x and so on red. Similarly, Floyd skips y - 1 consecutive bricks, then he paints the y-th one. Hence he'll paint bricks y, 2·y, 3·y and so on pink.After painting the wall all day, the boys observed that some bricks are painted both red and pink. Iahub has a lucky number a and Floyd has a lucky number b. Boys wonder how many bricks numbered no less than a and no greater than b are painted both red and pink. This is exactly your task: compute and print the answer to the question. 

InputThe input will have a single line containing four integers in this order: x, y, a, b. (1 ≤ x, y ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 2·109, a ≤ b).

OutputOutput a single integer — the number of bricks numbered no less than a and no greater than b that are painted both red and pink.
