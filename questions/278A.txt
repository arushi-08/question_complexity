The circle line of the Berland subway has n stations. We know the distances between all pairs of neighboring stations: d1 is the distance between the 1-st and the 2-nd station; d2 is the distance between the 2-nd and the 3-rd station;... dn - 1 is the distance between the n - 1-th and the n-th station; dn is the distance between the n-th and the 1-st station.The trains go along the circle line in both directions. Find the shortest distance between stations with numbers s and t.

InputThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the number of stations on the circle line. The second line contains n integers d1, d2, ..., dn (1 ≤ di ≤ 100) — the distances between pairs of neighboring stations. The third line contains two integers s and t (1 ≤ s, t ≤ n) — the numbers of stations, between which you need to find the shortest distance. These numbers can be the same.The numbers in the lines are separated by single spaces.

OutputPrint a single number — the length of the shortest path between stations number s and t.
