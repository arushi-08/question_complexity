Having watched the last Harry Potter film, little Gerald also decided to practice magic. He found in his father's magical book a spell that turns any number in the sum of its digits. At the moment Gerald learned that, he came across a number n. How many times can Gerald put a spell on it until the number becomes one-digit?
