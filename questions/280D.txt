Consider integer sequence a1, a2, ..., an. You should run queries of two types:  The query format is "0 i val". In reply to this query you should make the following assignment: ai = val.  The query format is "1 l r k". In reply to this query you should print the maximum sum of at most k non-intersecting subsegments of sequence al, al + 1, ..., ar. Formally, you should choose at most k pairs of integers (x1, y1), (x2, y2), ..., (xt, yt) (l ≤ x1 ≤ y1 < x2 ≤ y2 < ... < xt ≤ yt ≤ r; t ≤ k) such that the sum ax1 + ax1 + 1 + ... + ay1 + ax2 + ax2 + 1 + ... + ay2 + ... + axt + axt + 1 + ... + ayt is as large as possible. Note that you should choose at most k subsegments. Particularly, you can choose 0 subsegments. In this case the described sum considered equal to zero. 

InputThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 105), showing how many numbers the sequence has. The next line contains n integers a1, a2, ..., an (|ai| ≤ 500). The third line contains integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 105) — the number of queries. The next m lines contain the queries in the format, given in the statement.All changing queries fit into limits: 1 ≤ i ≤ n, |val| ≤ 500.All queries to count the maximum sum of at most k non-intersecting subsegments fit into limits: 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n, 1 ≤ k ≤ 20. It is guaranteed that the number of the queries to count the maximum sum of at most k non-intersecting subsegments doesn't exceed 10000.

OutputFor each query to count the maximum sum of at most k non-intersecting subsegments print the reply — the maximum sum. Print the answers to the queries in the order, in which the queries follow in the input.
