Yaroslav has an array that consists of n integers. In one second Yaroslav can swap two neighboring array elements. Now Yaroslav is wondering if he can obtain an array where any two neighboring elements would be distinct in a finite time.Help Yaroslav.

InputThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the number of elements in the array. The second line contains n integers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 1000) — the array elements.

OutputIn the single line print "YES" (without the quotes) if Yaroslav can obtain the array he needs, and "NO" (without the quotes) otherwise.
