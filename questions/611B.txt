The year 2015 is almost over.Limak is a little polar bear. He has recently learnt about the binary system. He noticed that the passing year has exactly one zero in its representation in the binary system — 201510 = 111110111112. Note that he doesn't care about the number of zeros in the decimal representation.Limak chose some interval of years. He is going to count all years from this interval that have exactly one zero in the binary representation. Can you do it faster?Assume that all positive integers are always written without leading zeros.

InputThe only line of the input contains two integers a and b (1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ 1018) — the first year and the last year in Limak's interval respectively.

OutputPrint one integer – the number of years Limak will count in his chosen interval.
