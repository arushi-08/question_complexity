You are given a string S of length n with each character being one of the first m lowercase English letters. Calculate how many different strings T of length n composed from the first m lowercase English letters exist such that the length of LCS (longest common subsequence) between S and T is n - 1.Recall that LCS of two strings S and T is the longest string C such that C both in S and T as a subsequence.

InputThe first line contains two numbers n and m denoting the length of string S and number of first English lowercase characters forming the character set for strings (1 ≤ n ≤ 100 000, 2 ≤ m ≤ 26).The second line contains string S.

OutputPrint the only line containing the answer.
