Two players are playing a game. First each of them writes an integer from 1 to 6, and then a dice is thrown. The player whose written number got closer to the number on the dice wins. If both payers have the same difference, it's a draw.The first player wrote number a, the second player wrote number b. How many ways to throw a dice are there, at which the first player wins, or there is a draw, or the second player wins?

InputThe single line contains two integers a and b (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 6) — the numbers written on the paper by the first and second player, correspondingly.

OutputPrint three integers: the number of ways to throw the dice at which the first player wins, the game ends with a draw or the second player wins, correspondingly.
