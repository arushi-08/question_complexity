Fox Ciel has a robot on a 2D plane. Initially it is located in (0, 0). Fox Ciel code a command to it. The command was represented by string s. Each character of s is one move operation. There are four move operations at all:  'U': go up, (x, y)  →  (x, y+1);  'D': go down, (x, y)  →  (x, y-1);  'L': go left, (x, y)  →  (x-1, y);  'R': go right, (x, y)  →  (x+1, y). The robot will do the operations in s from left to right, and repeat it infinite times. Help Fox Ciel to determine if after some steps the robot will located in (a, b).

InputThe first line contains two integers a and b, ( - 109 ≤ a, b ≤ 109). The second line contains a string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 100, s only contains characters 'U', 'D', 'L', 'R') — the command.

OutputPrint "Yes" if the robot will be located at (a, b), and "No" otherwise.
