You are given a square matrix of integer numbers. Rotate it 90 degrees clockwise (see examples for clarification of rotation).

InputThe input consists of n lines (1 ≤ n ≤ 10, n is not given explicitly). Each of the lines contains n space-separated integers; j-th integer in i-th line corresponds to matrix element mij (1 ≤ mij ≤ 100).

OutputOutput the rotated matrix in the same format as the input.
