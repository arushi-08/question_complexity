There are three arrays a, b and c. Each of them consists of n integers. SmallY wants to find three integers u, v, w (0 ≤ u, v, w ≤ n) such that the following condition holds: each number that appears in the union of a, b and c, appears either in the first u elements of a, or in the first v elements of b, or in the first w elements of c. Of course, SmallY doesn't want to have huge numbers u, v and w, so she wants sum u + v + w to be as small as possible.Please, help her to find the minimal possible sum of u + v + w.

InputThe first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 105). The second line contains n space-separated integers a1, a2, ..., an — array a. The third line contains the description of array b in the same format. The fourth line contains the description of array c in the same format. The following constraint holds: 1 ≤ ai, bi, ci ≤ 109.

OutputPrint a single integer — the minimum possible sum of u + v + w.
