Ayrat has number n, represented as it's prime factorization pi of size m, i.e. n = p1·p2·...·pm. Ayrat got secret information that that the product of all divisors of n taken modulo 109 + 7 is the password to the secret data base. Now he wants to calculate this value.

InputThe first line of the input contains a single integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 200 000) — the number of primes in factorization of n. The second line contains m primes numbers pi (2 ≤ pi ≤ 200 000).

OutputPrint one integer — the product of all divisors of n modulo 109 + 7.
