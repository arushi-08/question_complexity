You are given three strings (s1, s2, s3). For each integer l (1 ≤ l ≤ min(|s1|, |s2|, |s3|) you need to find how many triples (i1, i2, i3) exist such that three strings sk[ik... ik + l - 1] (k = 1, 2, 3) are pairwise equal. Print all found numbers modulo 1000000007 (109 + 7).See notes if you are not sure about some of the denotions used in the statement.

InputFirst three lines contain three non-empty input strings. The sum of lengths of all strings is no more than 3·105. All strings consist only of lowercase English letters.

OutputYou need to output min(|s1|, |s2|, |s3|) numbers separated by spaces — answers for the problem modulo 1000000007 (109 + 7).
