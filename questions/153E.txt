You are given a multiset of points on the plane with integer coordinates. Find the maximum distance between two points from this multiset.

InputThe first line of input contains the number of points n (2 ≤ n ≤ 50). Next, n pairs of lines follow, each describing a single point: the first line contains x-coordinate, the second one — the y-coordinate ( - 50 ≤ x, y ≤ 50). Some of the points can have identical coordinates.

OutputOutput the maximum distance between two points from this multiset. The answer is considered to be correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10 - 4.
