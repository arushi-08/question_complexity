You are given a sequence of numbers a1, a2, ..., an, and a number m.Check if it is possible to choose a non-empty subsequence aij such that the sum of numbers in this subsequence is divisible by m.

InputThe first line contains two numbers, n and m (1 ≤ n ≤ 106, 2 ≤ m ≤ 103) — the size of the original sequence and the number such that sum should be divisible by it.The second line contains n integers a1, a2, ..., an (0 ≤ ai ≤ 109).

OutputIn the single line print either "YES" (without the quotes) if there exists the sought subsequence, or "NO" (without the quotes), if such subsequence doesn't exist.
