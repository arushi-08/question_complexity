You are given an array of n integers. For each element output the sum of itself and the previous element. For the first element, output the sum of the first and the last elements of the array.

InputThe input consists of a single line of space-separated integers. The first number is n (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) — the size of the array. The following n numbers are the elements of the array (1 ≤ ai ≤ 1000).

OutputOutput the sums a1 + an, a2 + a1, ..., an + an - 1, separated with spaces.
