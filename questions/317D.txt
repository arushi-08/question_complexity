Vasya and Petya wrote down all integers from 1 to n to play the "powers" game (n can be quite large; however, Vasya and Petya are not confused by this fact).Players choose numbers in turn (Vasya chooses first). If some number x is chosen at the current turn, it is forbidden to choose x or all of its other positive integer powers (that is, x2, x3, ...) at the next turns. For instance, if the number 9 is chosen at the first turn, one cannot choose 9 or 81 later, while it is still allowed to choose 3 or 27. The one who cannot make a move loses.Who wins if both Vasya and Petya play optimally?

InputInput contains single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 109).

OutputPrint the name of the winner — "Vasya" or "Petya" (without quotes).
