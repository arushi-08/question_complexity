You want to arrange n integers a1, a2, ..., an in some order in a row. Let's define the value of an arrangement as the sum of differences between all pairs of adjacent integers.More formally, let's denote some arrangement as a sequence of integers x1, x2, ..., xn, where sequence x is a permutation of sequence a. The value of such an arrangement is (x1 - x2) + (x2 - x3) + ... + (xn - 1 - xn).Find the largest possible value of an arrangement. Then, output the lexicographically smallest sequence x that corresponds to an arrangement of the largest possible value.

InputThe first line of the input contains integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 100). The second line contains n space-separated integers a1, a2, ..., an (|ai| ≤ 1000).

OutputPrint the required sequence x1, x2, ..., xn. Sequence x should be the lexicographically smallest permutation of a that corresponds to an arrangement of the largest possible value.
