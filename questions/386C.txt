String diversity is the number of symbols that occur in the string at least once. Diversity of s will be denoted by d(s). For example , d("aaa")=1, d("abacaba")=3.Given a string s, consisting of lowercase Latin letters. Consider all its substrings. Obviously, any substring diversity is a number from 1 to d(s). Find statistics about substrings diversity: for each k from 1 to d(s), find how many substrings of s has a diversity of exactly k.

InputThe input consists of a single line containing s. It contains only lowercase Latin letters, the length of s is from 1 to 3·105.

OutputPrint to the first line the value d(s). Print sequence t1, t2, ..., td(s) to the following lines, where ti is the number of substrings of s having diversity of exactly i.
