A tennis tournament with n participants is running. The participants are playing by an olympic system, so the winners move on and the losers drop out.The tournament takes place in the following way (below, m is the number of the participants of the current round):  let k be the maximal power of the number 2 such that k ≤ m,  k participants compete in the current round and a half of them passes to the next round, the other m - k participants pass to the next round directly,  when only one participant remains, the tournament finishes. Each match requires b bottles of water for each participant and one bottle for the judge. Besides p towels are given to each participant for the whole tournament.Find the number of bottles and towels needed for the tournament.Note that it's a tennis tournament so in each match two participants compete (one of them will win and the other will lose).

InputThe only line contains three integers n, b, p (1 ≤ n, b, p ≤ 500) — the number of participants and the parameters described in the problem statement.

OutputPrint two integers x and y — the number of bottles and towels need for the tournament.
