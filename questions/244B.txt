Polycarpus loves lucky numbers. Everybody knows that lucky numbers are positive integers, whose decimal representation (without leading zeroes) contain only the lucky digits x and y. For example, if x = 4, and y = 7, then numbers 47, 744, 4 are lucky.Let's call a positive integer a undoubtedly lucky, if there are such digits x and y (0 ≤ x, y ≤ 9), that the decimal representation of number a (without leading zeroes) contains only digits x and y.Polycarpus has integer n. He wants to know how many positive integers that do not exceed n, are undoubtedly lucky. Help him, count this number.

InputThe first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 109) — Polycarpus's number.

OutputPrint a single integer that says, how many positive integers that do not exceed n are undoubtedly lucky.
