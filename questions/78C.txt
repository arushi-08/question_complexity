Two beavers, Timur and Marsel, play the following game.There are n logs, each of exactly m meters in length. The beavers move in turns. For each move a beaver chooses a log and gnaws it into some number (more than one) of equal parts, the length of each one is expressed by an integer and is no less than k meters. Each resulting part is also a log which can be gnawed in future by any beaver. The beaver that can't make a move loses. Thus, the other beaver wins.Timur makes the first move. The players play in the optimal way. Determine the winner.

InputThe first line contains three integers n, m, k (1 ≤ n, m, k ≤ 109).

OutputPrint "Timur", if Timur wins, or "Marsel", if Marsel wins. You should print everything without the quotes.
