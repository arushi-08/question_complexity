Misha has an array of n integers indexed by integers from 1 to n. Let's define palindrome degree of array a as the number of such index pairs (l, r)(1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n), that the elements from the l-th to the r-th one inclusive can be rearranged in such a way that the whole array will be a palindrome. In other words, pair (l, r) should meet the condition that after some rearranging of numbers on positions from l to r, inclusive (it is allowed not to rearrange the numbers at all), for any 1 ≤ i ≤ n following condition holds: a[i] = a[n - i + 1]. Your task is to find the palindrome degree of Misha's array.

InputThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 105).The second line contains n positive integers a[i] (1 ≤ a[i] ≤ n), separated by spaces — the elements of Misha's array.

OutputIn a single line print the answer to the problem.
