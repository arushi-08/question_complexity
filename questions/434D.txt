Nanami likes playing games, and is also really good at it. This day she was playing a new game which involved operating a power plant. Nanami's job is to control the generators in the plant and produce maximum output.There are n generators in the plant. Each generator should be set to a generating level. Generating level is an integer (possibly zero or negative), the generating level of the i-th generator should be between li and ri (both inclusive). The output of a generator can be calculated using a certain quadratic function f(x), where x is the generating level of the generator. Each generator has its own function, the function of the i-th generator is denoted as fi(x).However, there are m further restrictions to the generators. Let the generating level of the i-th generator be xi. Each restriction is of the form xu ≤ xv + d, where u and v are IDs of two different generators and d is an integer.Nanami found the game tedious but giving up is against her creed. So she decided to have a program written to calculate the answer for her (the maximum total output of generators). Somehow, this became your job.

InputThe first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n ≤ 50; 0 ≤ m ≤ 100) — the number of generators and the number of restrictions.Then follow n lines, each line contains three integers ai, bi, and ci (|ai| ≤ 10; |bi|, |ci| ≤ 1000) — the coefficients of the function fi(x). That is, fi(x) = aix2 + bix + ci.Then follow another n lines, each line contains two integers li and ri ( - 100 ≤ li ≤ ri ≤ 100).Then follow m lines, each line contains three integers ui, vi, and di (1 ≤ ui, vi ≤ n; ui ≠ vi; |di| ≤ 200), describing a restriction. The i-th restriction is xui ≤ xvi + di.

OutputPrint a single line containing a single integer — the maximum output of all the generators. It is guaranteed that there exists at least one valid configuration.
