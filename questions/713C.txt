Sonya was unable to think of a story for this problem, so here comes the formal description.You are given the array containing n positive integers. At one turn you can pick any element and increase or decrease it by 1. The goal is the make the array strictly increasing by making the minimum possible number of operations. You are allowed to change elements in any way, they can become negative or equal to 0.

InputThe first line of the input contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 3000) — the length of the array.Next line contains n integer ai (1 ≤ ai ≤ 109).

OutputPrint the minimum number of operation required to make the array strictly increasing.
