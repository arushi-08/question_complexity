Levko loves permutations very much. A permutation of length n is a sequence of distinct positive integers, each is at most n.Let’s assume that value gcd(a, b) shows the greatest common divisor of numbers a and b. Levko assumes that element pi of permutation p1, p2, ... , pn is good if gcd(i, pi) > 1. Levko considers a permutation beautiful, if it has exactly k good elements. Unfortunately, he doesn’t know any beautiful permutation. Your task is to help him to find at least one of them.

InputThe single line contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 105, 0 ≤ k ≤ n).

OutputIn a single line print either any beautiful permutation or -1, if such permutation doesn’t exist.If there are multiple suitable permutations, you are allowed to print any of them.
