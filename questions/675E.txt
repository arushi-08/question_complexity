Vasya commutes by train every day. There are n train stations in the city, and at the i-th station it's possible to buy only tickets to stations from i + 1 to ai inclusive. No tickets are sold at the last station.Let ρi, j be the minimum number of tickets one needs to buy in order to get from stations i to station j. As Vasya is fond of different useless statistic he asks you to compute the sum of all values ρi, j among all pairs 1 ≤ i < j ≤ n.

InputThe first line of the input contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 100 000) — the number of stations.The second line contains n - 1 integer ai (i + 1 ≤ ai ≤ n), the i-th of them means that at the i-th station one may buy tickets to each station from i + 1 to ai inclusive.

OutputPrint the sum of ρi, j among all pairs of 1 ≤ i < j ≤ n.
