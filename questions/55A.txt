A flea is sitting at one of the n hassocks, arranged in a circle, at the moment. After minute number k the flea jumps through k - 1 hassoсks (clockwise). For example, after the first minute the flea jumps to the neighboring hassock. You should answer: will the flea visit all the hassocks or not. We assume that flea has infinitely much time for this jumping.

InputThe only line contains single integer: 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000 — number of hassocks.

OutputOutput "YES" if all the hassocks will be visited and "NO" otherwise.
