The j-th person standing in the queue to the i-th cashier has mi, j items in the basket. Vasya knows that:  the cashier needs 5 seconds to scan one item;  after the cashier scans each item of some customer, he needs 15 seconds to take the customer's money and give him the change. Of course, Vasya wants to select a queue so that he can leave the supermarket as soon as possible. Help him write a program that displays the minimum number of seconds after which Vasya can get to one of the cashiers.

InputThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the number of cashes in the shop. The second line contains n space-separated integers: k1, k2, ..., kn (1 ≤ ki ≤ 100), where ki is the number of people in the queue to the i-th cashier.The i-th of the next n lines contains ki space-separated integers: mi, 1, mi, 2, ..., mi, ki (1 ≤ mi, j ≤ 100) — the number of products the j-th person in the queue for the i-th cash has.
