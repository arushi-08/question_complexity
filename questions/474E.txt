Marmot found a row with n pillars. The i-th pillar has the height of hi meters. Starting from one pillar i1, Marmot wants to jump on the pillars i2, ..., ik. (1 ≤ i1 < i2 < ... < ik ≤ n). From a pillar i Marmot can jump on a pillar j only if i < j and |hi - hj| ≥ d, where |x| is the absolute value of the number x.Now Marmot is asking you find out a jump sequence with maximal length and print it.

InputThe first line contains two integers n and d (1 ≤ n ≤ 105, 0 ≤ d ≤ 109).The second line contains n numbers h1, h2, ..., hn (1 ≤ hi ≤ 1015).

OutputThe first line should contain one integer k, the maximal length of a jump sequence.The second line should contain k integers i1, i2, ..., ik (1 ≤ i1 < i2 < ... < ik ≤ n), representing the pillars' indices from the maximal length jump sequence.If there is more than one maximal length jump sequence, print any.
