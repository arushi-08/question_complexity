Inna loves sweets very much. That's why she wants to play the "Sweet Matrix" game with Dima and Sereja. But Sereja is a large person, so the game proved small for him. Sereja suggested playing the "Large Sweet Matrix" game.The "Large Sweet Matrix" playing field is an n × m matrix. Let's number the rows of the matrix from 1 to n, and the columns — from 1 to m. Let's denote the cell in the i-th row and j-th column as (i, j). Each cell of the matrix can contain multiple candies, initially all cells are empty. The game goes in w moves, during each move one of the two following events occurs:  Sereja chooses five integers x1, y1, x2, y2, v (x1 ≤ x2, y1 ≤ y2) and adds v candies to each matrix cell (i, j) (x1 ≤ i ≤ x2; y1 ≤ j ≤ y2).  Sereja chooses four integers x1, y1, x2, y2 (x1 ≤ x2, y1 ≤ y2). Then he asks Dima to calculate the total number of candies in cells (i, j) (x1 ≤ i ≤ x2; y1 ≤ j ≤ y2) and he asks Inna to calculate the total number of candies in the cells of matrix (p, q), which meet the following logical criteria: (p < x1 OR p > x2) AND (q < y1 OR q > y2). Finally, Sereja asks to write down the difference between the number Dima has calculated and the number Inna has calculated (D - I). Unfortunately, Sereja's matrix is really huge. That's why Inna and Dima aren't coping with the calculating. Help them!

InputThe first line of the input contains three integers n, m and w (3 ≤ n, m ≤ 4·106; 1 ≤ w ≤ 105).The next w lines describe the moves that were made in the game.   A line that describes an event of the first type contains 6 integers: 0, x1, y1, x2, y2 and v (1 ≤ x1 ≤ x2 ≤ n; 1 ≤ y1 ≤ y2 ≤ m; 1 ≤ v ≤ 109).  A line that describes an event of the second type contains 5 integers: 1, x1, y1, x2, y2 (2 ≤ x1 ≤ x2 ≤ n - 1; 2 ≤ y1 ≤ y2 ≤ m - 1). It is guaranteed that the second type move occurs at least once. It is guaranteed that a single operation will not add more than 109 candies.Be careful, the constraints are very large, so please use optimal data structures. Max-tests will be in pretests.

OutputFor each second type move print a single integer on a single line — the difference between Dima and Inna's numbers.
