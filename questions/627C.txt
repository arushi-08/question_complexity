Johnny drives a truck and must deliver a package from his hometown to the district center. His hometown is located at point 0 on a number line, and the district center is located at the point d.Johnny's truck has a gas tank that holds exactly n liters, and his tank is initially full. As he drives, the truck consumes exactly one liter per unit distance traveled. Moreover, there are m gas stations located at various points along the way to the district center. The i-th station is located at the point xi on the number line and sells an unlimited amount of fuel at a price of pi dollars per liter. Find the minimum cost Johnny must pay for fuel to successfully complete the delivery.

InputThe first line of input contains three space separated integers d, n, and m (1 ≤ n ≤ d ≤ 109, 1 ≤ m ≤ 200 000) — the total distance to the district center, the volume of the gas tank, and the number of gas stations, respectively.Each of the next m lines contains two integers xi, pi (1 ≤ xi ≤ d - 1, 1 ≤ pi ≤ 106) — the position and cost of gas at the i-th gas station. It is guaranteed that the positions of the gas stations are distinct.

OutputPrint a single integer — the minimum cost to complete the delivery. If there is no way to complete the delivery, print -1.
