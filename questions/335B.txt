Given a string s, determine if it contains any palindrome of length exactly 100 as a subsequence. If it has any, print any one of them. If it doesn't have any, print a palindrome that is a subsequence of s and is as long as possible.

InputThe only line of the input contains one string s of length n (1 ≤ n ≤ 5·104) containing only lowercase English letters.

OutputIf s contains a palindrome of length exactly 100 as a subsequence, print any palindrome of length 100 which is a subsequence of s. If s doesn't contain any palindromes of length exactly 100, print a palindrome that is a subsequence of s and is as long as possible.If there exists multiple answers, you are allowed to print any of them.
