There are n cockroaches living in Anatoly's room.Anatoly just made all his cockroaches to form a single line. As he is a perfectionist, he would like the colors of cockroaches in the line to alternate. He has a can of black paint and a can of red paint. In one turn he can either swap any two cockroaches, or take any single cockroach and change it's color.Help Anatoly find out the minimum number of turns he needs to make the colors of cockroaches in the line alternate.

InputThe first line of the input contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100 000) — the number of cockroaches.The second line contains a string of length n, consisting of characters 'b' and 'r' that denote black cockroach and red cockroach respectively.

OutputPrint one integer — the minimum number of moves Anatoly has to perform in order to make the colors of cockroaches in the line to alternate.
